This documentation reflects the latest version of the plugin. You can find the latest version on [Github]({{% siteparam "github_repo" %}}). Our plugin supports the following:
+ Magento version 2.3.x.
+ Magento version 2.4.x.

We do not recommend customizing the plugin, because this could make it harder to upgrade and maintain your integration. If you decide to customize, we recommend that you:
+ Keep track of the custom code added to your integration.
+ Create an issue on [Github]({{% siteparam "github_issues" %}}) if you want to suggest a new feature for the plugin.
+ Follow the customization best practices outlined by the [Adobe Commerce DevDocs](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/php/architecture/modules/).
